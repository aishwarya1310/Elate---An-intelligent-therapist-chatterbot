# Elate---An-intelligent-therapist-chatterbot

In this project, an intelligent therapist chatterbot mobile application will converse with the user by first analysing the
sentiment or mood of the user and thereby initializing a positive, negative or neutral chat format to motivate and elate the user.
Developed a whole chatterbot using Android Studio & used Firebase to store user’s ID and password. Performed some
executions in Natural Language Processing. Used IntelliJ, to execute the programs related to analysing the user’s mood or sentiment.
